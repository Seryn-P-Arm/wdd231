            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p>
                <b>The Art Den</b><br>

                I chose this site name because I love art and want to
                incorporate mycoding skills into something that I would actually 
                use in real life, beyond this class. And I have a pretty 
                good idea on what I want to do with it. I also want the site to be 
                and enjoyable, fun, comfortable experience for users.
            </p>

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                This site provides users the ability to make commissions for 
                art work that will be done by me, their requests will be detailed 
                and made into a form on a commissions page, and they will be able to
                view an art gallery page that has most or all of my artworks that I 
                have done in the past to give them a chance to see if they like the styles. 
                It will also provide information on the background and guidance on how 
                how to make a commission, factors to consider, view promotions or merch, 
                view sponsorships and collabs and request for collabs by signing up to join
                my Art Den as a partner, and their name and artist details will be displayed 
                as a member in the site. They will be able to find more info in it
                by clicking a button.
            </p>

            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p>
                I want to commission a custom piece of artwork, but I’m not sure where to start. What kind of details do I need to provide, and how long will it take to complete?
                I’m an artist interested in collaborating with Art Den. How can I join as a partner, and what benefits do I get by being part of the Art Den community?
            </p>
